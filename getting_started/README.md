How C++ works

#include :-anything that starts with an # is a preprocessor statement. They run before the actual compilation.
#include <iostream> means include will find a header file called iostream and paste the content of the file in the current file.

# The entry point
the main function is the entry point, each line of code is read line by line.

# compile
stage where the compiler converts c++ code into machine code.

header files do not get files
cpp file will be compiled into obj file
Linker takes all obj files into an exe file
